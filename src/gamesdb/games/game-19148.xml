Namely, collecting your ingredients, learning new recipes, creating powerful items and completing missions set by the guild. In this game where you have a schedule to follow, every moment counts. The Sony PS Vita game includes new modes and upgrades. People who adore Totori's motherly elder sister Ceci can include her in the playing team right away. There are also new enhancements and contents exclusive to the PS Vita version. Play the game and find out what these are.</Overview>
