<Overview>FIFA 13 (also known as FIFA Soccer 13 in North America) is the 2012 edition of Electronic Arts' association football FIFA video game series. It was developed by EA Canada. A demo of the game was released on 11 September 2012; the demo teams included Borussia Dortmund, Manchester City, Juventus, A.C. Milan and Arsenal.[1] The demo was downloaded a record 1.99 million times within three days.[2][3][4] The game was released in late September 2012 in most regions, and in Japan in October.[a] The Wii U version was released alongside the console on its launch day in all regions. FIFA 13 included new features to the FIFA franchise such as the First Touch Control.[2][5][6][7] As of December 2014, the game remains the only FIFA title released for the Wii U, despite other Nintendo consoles receiving later games. New celebrations were also added as a new feature.[8] The game received overwhelmingly positive reviews as one of the best FIFA's yet, praised for its fast-paced, fun feel.[9]</Overview>
