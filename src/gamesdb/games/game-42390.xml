<Overview>The final installment of the supernatural story that began with Corpse Party and continued in Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, Corpse Party: Blood Drive ups the ante by allowing players to explore Heavenly Host Elementary in full 3D for the first time, with all of its formerly 2D environments meticulously recreated and greatly expanded. New gameplay systems provide more exciting interactions for players experiencing the gruesome finale to this tale of an inescapable, otherworldly school populated by vengeful spirits, including a dynamic lighting system aided by an in-game flashlight, talismans to protect the player characters from danger, deadly traps to disarm, cabinets to hide in, a stamina system that allows for limited dashing, and much more.

Furthermore, Blood Drive -- once again presented with the original Japanese voiceovers for authenticity -- features the return of previously offered gameplay elements such as binaural 3D audio for simulated surround sound and the screen-altering "Darkening" system, as well as bonus unlockables such as voice actor interviews, art, music, and more. Boasting 11 huge story chapters and 8 supplemental "Extra Chapters," Blood Drive caps off the Heavenly Host storyline in a big way, providing answers and shocking twists in equal measure.</Overview>
