<Overview>Thomas Was Alone is an indie puzzle platformer video game created by Mike Bithell, originally released as a Flash-based browser game in October 2010. The game was expanded and released to Microsoft Windows and OS X systems in July 2012. PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita versions with new content were released in April 2013, while a Linux version was released as part of the game's inclusion in a Humble Bundle in May 2013.

In the game, the player controls one or more simple polygon shapes representing several out-of-control artificial intelligence entities, working with the shapes to get each to their individual end points on each level. Each shape is characterized with a unique name and personality, including the eponymous Thomas, which are conveyed to the player through the use of a narrator, voiced by Danny Wallace and whose performance earned the game a BAFTA Games Award.</Overview>
