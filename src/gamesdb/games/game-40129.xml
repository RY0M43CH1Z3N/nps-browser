<Overview>Valkyrie Drive: Bhikkhuni is the OUTRAGEOUS new project by the creators of Senran Kagura that combines high octane busty brawling and an awesome aerial based combat system with pleasure based weaponry and destructible clothing. This is the cheeky third person action game you have been waiting for ALL your life! In the world of Valkyrie Drive, a group of girls have been infected with the mysterious Armed Virus. When infected, the girls either become Extars who transform into high powered weapons when sexually aroused, or Liberators who after triggering a transformation, have the power to wield the Exter's weapon form, the Liberator Arms. Grinding for new and more powerful weapons will never be tedious again!</Overview>
