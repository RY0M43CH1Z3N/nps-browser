<Overview>Murasaki Baby tells the story of a little girl who wakes up in a weird world, populated by children’s fantasies and fears. Holding a purple, heart-shaped balloon in her hand, she feels lost, homesick and vulnerable. She wants her mommy.

The player can grab Baby’s hand with their finger to guide her through a nightmarish journey to find her Mother. This peculiar interaction amplifies the emotional bonding with Baby, allowing players to live a truly unique experience.

Unconventional and artistically crafted artworks shape the world of Murasaki Baby; players will go through a uniquely hand-drawn world of wonder. Combined with the original soundtrack, fully composed and produced in-house, the game is designed to challenge convention and move its audience.</Overview>
